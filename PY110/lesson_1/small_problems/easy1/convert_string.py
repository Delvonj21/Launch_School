# **UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM**:
# - read the problem description
# - identify inputs/outputs
# - identify rules/requirements
# - ask clarifying questions
# - examine all examples/test cases
# **EXAMPLES / TEST CASES**:
# - understand how the input translates to output
# - identify edge cases
# 	- can my program handle 0s, empty (list, strings, or dictionaries/sets),  or negative numbers?
# - create the test cases and confirm outputs
# **DATA STRUCTURES**:
# - what kind of data are you primarily dealing with?
# 	- strings, lists, integers, objects, etc..
# - this helps you focus on methods for these types
# **ALGORITHM**:
# - step by step process that takes you from input to output
# - handles edges cases and valid example inputs
# - your code will depend on your algorithm
# **CODE:**
# - time to write the code!
# - use everything you've gathered in your PEDAC to write the code
# **Debug** (if needed)
# - if there are errors in output, don't panic!
# - carefully review algorithm before looking at ypur code
# - once you've identified the issue, change the algorithm first, then fix the code
# - try again!


# Write a function that takes a string of digits and returns the appropriate number as an integer. You may not use any of the standard conversion functions available in Python, such as int. Your function should calculate the result by using the characters in the string.

# For now, do not worry about leading + or - signs, nor should you worry about invalid characters; assume all characters are numeric.
