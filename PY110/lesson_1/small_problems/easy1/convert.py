# Write a function that converts a non-negative integer value (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on) to the string representation of that integer.

# You may not use any of the standard conversion functions available in Python, such as str. Your function should do this the old-fashioned way and construct the string by analyzing and manipulating the number.
