## P: Understand the Problem
 - Establish rules and define the boundaries of the problem
 - Restate the problem in your own words
 - Identify problem requirements:
 	- Explicit
 		- Those that are clearly stated in the problem description
 	- Implicit
 		- Those that are not stated in the problem description, but can be extrapolated from our understanding of the problem based on problem analysis, examples, test cases, and so on.
 - Identify inputs and outputs
 - Ask questions/ identify unclear information
 - Spend enough time here. Don't rush. 

## E: Examples and Test Cases
 - Can be used to confirm or refute assumptions
 - Answer questions and provide implicit requirements
 - Test cases are written in code and can be run to test your solution
 - Codify the rules and boundaries of the problem

## D: Data Structures
 - Thinking in terms of data structures is an important part of the problem solving process
 - Helps reason with data logically
 - Helps interact with data at the implementation stage
 - Data structures are closely linked to the algorithm used for your solution

## A: Algorithms
 - A logical sequence of steps for accomplishing a task or objective
 - Closely related to data structures
 - At first, keep your algorith abstract and high level
 - Break down steps and fill in details as needed
 - Don't worry about efficiency at this stage

## C: Implementing a Solution in Code 
 - Translating your solution algorithm into code
 	- Think about our algorithm in the context of the programming language
 		- Features and constraints
 		- Characteristics of data structures
 		- Built in methods or functions
 		- Syntax/ general patterns
 	- Create any test cases
 - Code with intent
