# What will the following code do and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

if True:
    my_value = 20

print(my_value)

# The following code will print 20
# The variable 'my_value' is assigned inside the if block making it accessible outside the if block, and since 20 evaluates to True you would print the value for the variable 'my_value' 20
